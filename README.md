"# euler" 

This contains all my Project Euler problem solutions. To see the raw code, go to the number of the problem you want to see (###) projectEuler### -> projectEuler### -> Program.cs

Program.cs contains the raw code for my C# solutions.


Some solutions in here are not currently complete and are being worked on. These include:
69, 72, 94, 99, 549

I didn't save my first few solutions as I did not think I would get so far, I am in the process of redoing the first few and adding their solutions to here, that includes:
11, 12, 14-17, 20, 21, 25, 27

I have a file called sieveOfEratosthenes in my euler problems because I found someone's sieve code which I used in several problems involving prime numbers, and I wanted to give him credit for his code as it has been extremely useful to me.
