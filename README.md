"# euler" 

This contains all my Project Euler problem solutions. To see the raw code, go to the number of the problem you want to see (###) projectEuler### -> projectEuler### -> Program.cs

Program.cs contains the raw code for my C# solutions.


Some solutions in here are not currently complete and are being worked on. These include:
69, 72, 94, 99, 549

I didn't save my first few solutions as I did not think I would get so far, I am in the process of redoing the first few and adding their solutions to here, that includes:
7-17, 19-21, 25, 27
